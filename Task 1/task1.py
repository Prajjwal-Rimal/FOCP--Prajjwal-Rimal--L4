"""
A 50% discount applies to all pizza prices on Tuesdays. This discount does not apply to any delivery cost
(see below).

Delivery costs £2.50, unless there are five or more pizzas in the order, in which case it is free.

A discount of 25% of the total price (pizzas plus delivery, if required) is applied if the customer orders via the new
BPP App.

This is in addition to the Tuesday Discount, and is applied after that discount.

Your program will need to gather various information about the order,
and will then calculate and display the total price.

All money amounts should be displayed as pounds and pence; that is with two decimal places.
Any reasonable way to round odd amounts is fine."""
